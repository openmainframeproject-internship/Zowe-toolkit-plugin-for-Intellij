# How to read the documentation:
The format that is used for the documentation is pdf. Although GitHub can show the document, the hyperref links do not seem to work. The links are used to either refer to literature or to a code in this repository. Because of this reason, it is better to download the pdf files.

The Detailed Designed consists of several documents, so you can easily skip some parts or return to a section in the future. For first read we recommend to read the files in the Detailed Design directory sequentially.
